# SSOS - SIEGE SPACE OS

Siege Space OS is an OS installed on a spaceship. The users are the astronauts and everyone has access to the same terminal.

You can register as an astronaut on the landing page by setting a secure password. Then enter the A-ID and password to login!

`ls`    to list all files and folders in the current working directory

`cat`   to read content of a file

`touch` to create files with `touch <name> <content>`
